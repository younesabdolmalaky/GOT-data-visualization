Night's Watch soldiers are attacked by supernatural White Walkers. One soldier escapes but is captured at Castle Winterfell. Eddard \\\"Ned\\\" Stark, Warden of the North, executes him for desertion. Later, six orphaned dire wolf pups are found and one given to each Stark sibling, including Ned's bastard son, Jon Snow. In King's Landing, the Seven Kingdoms capital, Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, dies suddenly. King Robert Baratheon, Ned's old friend, travels to Winterfell to recruit Ned and propose a marriage between his heir Joffrey and Ned's daughter, Sansa. Lysa Arryn, Jon's widow, sends her sister (Ned's wife), Catelyn, a letter claiming the Lannisters, Queen Cersei's family, murdered Arryn. Catelyn believes the Lannisters are now plotting against King Robert. Ned's young son, Brandon, climbs a tall tower and witnesses Cersei and her twin brother, Jaime Lannister, inside having sex. To hide their incest, Jaime pushes Bran from the high window. Across the Narrow Sea in Essos, exiled Prince Viserys Targaryen forces his sister, Daenerys, to marry the Dothraki warlord, Drogo, in exchange for an army to conquer Westeros and reclaim the Iron Throne. The ancient Targaryens once commanded dragons, and Daenerys is given three fossilized dragon eggs as a wedding gift.\",\"Ned, the new Hand of the King, travels to King's Landing accompanied by his daughters, Sansa and Arya. Catelyn remains at Winterfell to care for the still unconscious Bran. An assassin attacks Bran, but Catelyn fends him off and Bran's direwolf, Summer, kills him. Catelyn suspects the Lannisters were behind the attack. Ned's illegitimate son, Jon, heads north with his uncle, Benjen Stark, to join the Night's Watch, the protectors of the Wall, a massive ice structure that keeps the Wildling tribes and the mythical White Walkers from civilized Westeros. Before departing, Jon gave tomboy Arya a thin sword she names, \\\"Needle\\\". Queen Cersei's younger brother, Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf also known as \\\"The Imp,\\\" accompanies Jon to the Wall. Along the Kingsroad on their way towards King's Landing, Prince Joffrey threatens Arya's young commoner friend, later having him killed. Nymeria, Arya's direwolf, defends her, biting Joffrey. Cersei demands that Robert have the wolf killed, but Arya releases Nymeria to the wild. Sansa's direwolf, Lady, is killed instead. In Winterfell, Brandon awakens, remembering nothing about his fall. Meanwhile, Daenerys is befriended by Ser Jorah Mormont, a disgraced knight, while she focuses on learning how to please Drogo.\",\"Ned attends the King's Small Council and learns Westeros has been poorly managed and is deeply in debt. Catelyn travels to King's Landing to covertly warn her husband about the assassination attempt, but she is intercepted by her childhood friend, Councillor Petyr \\\"Littlefinger\\\" Baelish. Bran learns he will never walk again and remains unable to remember the events leading to his fall. Jon struggles to adapt to life on the Wall. The once elite Night's Watch now recruits many low-born and/or convicted criminals who are unimpressed by Jon's bloodline. Lord Commander Mormont asks Tyrion to plead with the King to send more recruits to the Night's Watch. Daenerys, now pregnant, stands up to her brother, Viserys, threatening him if he ever abuses her again.\",\"While returning to King's Landing, Tyrion stops at Winterfell where he presents the Starks a saddle design that will allow the paraplegic Bran to ride a horse. Ned secretly investigates Jon Arryn's death. In the process, he discovers one of King Robert's illegitimate children, Gendry, an armorer. Robert and his guests attend a tournament honoring Ned, which Ned considers an extravagance. Jon takes measures to protect Samwell Tarly, an awkward and friendless Night's Watch recruit, from the other Watchmen's abuse. A frustrated Viserys clashes with his newly-empowered sister. Sansa dreams of one day becoming queen, while Arya envisions a far different future. At a roadside tavern, Catelyn, who is Lord Hoster Tully's daughter, unexpectedly encounters Tyrion Lannister. She rallies her father's Riverrun allies to arrest Tyrion for conspiring to murder her son.\",\"King Robert's eunuch spy, Varys, has uncovered that Daenerys Targaryen is pregnant. Ned rejects Robert's plan to assassinate her, considering Daenerys a non-threat. He resigns in protest as Robert's Hand, angering the king. Catelyn and her prisoner, Tyrion, arrive at her sister Lysa Arryn's fortress home in the Eyrie. News of Tyrion's capture reaches King's Landing where Jaime Lannister, the Queen's twin brother, demands answers from Ned. A vengeful Jaime orders Ned's men killed and fights Ned until Jaime's man stabs Ned in the leg from behind, leaving him wounded.\",\"King Robert reappoints Ned as Hand and tasks him with running affairs until Robert returns from hunting. Villagers from Riverrun arrive with news of atrocities committed by raiders, who Ned deduces were led by Ser Gregor Clegane, a Lannister retainer. Ned sentences Ser Gregor to death and summons Tywin Lannister to a trial. Ned decides to send Sansa (now reconciled with Joffrey) and Arya back to Winterfell. Ned has discovered that Joffrey and his two siblings are not Robert's biological children, and were fathered by Jaime Lannister. Bran, while testing his new saddle, is attacked by rogue Wildings. Robb, Ned's oldest son, and Theon, Ned's captive ward, whose father, King Balon, was a fallen rebel, rescue him, and the woman Wilding, Osha, is enslaved. In the Vale, Tyrion demands a trial by combat. Lysa chooses Ser Vardis as her champion. The sellsword Bronn volunteers as Tyrion's champion. He defeats Vardis and obtains Tyrion's release. Meanwhile, Viserys grows impatient and angry waiting for Drogo to fulfill his promise, and he threatens to kill Daenerys' unborn child. Drogo kills Viserys by pouring molten gold on his head.\",\"In King's Landing, Ned confronts Cersei, saying he knows Jaime fathered her children and will inform King Robert. Before he can, Robert is critically wounded while hunting boar. As Robert lies dying, he signs a proclamation naming Ned \\\"Protector of the Realm,\\\" until Robert's heir can assume the throne. Ned amends the wording to say the king's rightful heir. Ned sends word to Stannis, Robert's brother, the legal heir to the throne. Ned asks Petyr Baelish to secure the City Watch's loyalty. After Robert's death, Ned confronts Cersei and Joffrey in the throne room, where Baelish and the City Watch betray Ned and attack his men. At the Wall, Benjen Stark disappears during a foray north of the Wall. Jon and Sam are assigned as stewards, with Jon as Lord Commander Jeor Mormont's personal servant. Jon is disappointed he was not chosen as a ranger until Sam points out that Commander Mormont likely intends to groom him for command. The stewards swear their loyalties to the Night's Watch. In Essos, King Robert's hired assassin is exposed by Ser Jorah before he can poison Daenerys. Drogo vows to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for his unborn son and starts marching towards Westeros.\",\"Arya escapes the Red Keep after Syrio Forel, her Braavosian sword master, fends off guards sent to arrest her, while Sansa is captured.

At Eastwatch, the Night King, astride the undead Viserion, blasts a hole through the Wall with blue dragon fire; the Army of the Dead marches through.\",\"Upon reaching Winterfell with their combined armies, Jon and Daenerys learn the Army of the Dead has breached the Wall and the Night King commands the undead Viserion. The Northern Houses and the Vale rally around Winterfell but distrust Daenerys and doubt Cersei's pledge to send troops. Euron returns to King's Landing with the Golden Company and entices Cersei to consummate their union. Cersei, through Qyburn, hires Bronn to assassinate Tyrion and Jaime. Theon rescues Yara, who then sets out to retake the Iron Islands, while Theon returns to Winterfell. There, Jon is reunited with Arya. Jon and Daenerys ride the dragons and deepen their bond. Daenerys wants to reward Sam for saving Jorah before realizing that she executed his father and brother. Sam tells Jon that he was born Aegon Targaryen and is the true heir to the Iron Throne. At House Umber, Tormund and Beric encounter Edd and other Night's Watch members. They find the castle's occupants dead, and the wight of Ned Umber is left as a gruesome message. Jaime arrives at Winterfell where Bran awaits him.\",\"Jaime reveals Cersei's deception to the Targaryen-Stark alliance and joins them after Brienne vouches for his honor. Jaime apologizes to Bran for crippling him; Bran replies he harbors no anger and says they are no longer the same people. Daenerys no longer trusts Tyrion's judgment for his having believed Cersei, but Jorah asks that she forgive Tyrion's mistakes. Citing their mutual love for Jon, Daenerys tries to gain Sansa's trust, but Sansa says the North vowed never to bow to anyone again. Theon, Edd, Tormund, and Beric arrive at Winterfell, with the latter three reporting the undead army's impending arrival. Bran proposes he lure out the Night King, who intends to destroy the Three-Eyed Raven. Theon and the Ironborn will protect Bran. Arya seduces Gendry, wanting to experience it before they die. Jaime formally anoints Brienne as a knight. Jorah fails to dissuade Lyanna Mormont from fighting, and Sam presents Jorah with House Tarly's ancestral sword. As the Army of the Dead approaches, Jon reveals his true lineage to Daenerys, who realizes that he has a claim to the Iron Throne.\",\"The living meet the Army of the Dead outside Winterfell. The initial Dothraki charge is destroyed and the Unsullied are quickly overwhelmed, despite the dragonfire. Edd is killed saving Sam and survivors retreat into the castle. Melisandre ignites the fire trench surrounding Winterfell to delay the advancing horde. Jon and Daenerys aerially engage the Night King on their dragons. The wights invade Winterfell, overpowering the defenders; Lyanna Mormont is killed destroying a giant wight; Beric dies defending Arya and Melisandre tells Arya what she must do. Jon and Rhaegal knock the Night King off Viserion and Daenerys and Drogon burn him with dragonfire without any effect. The Night King raises the slain Winterfell soldiers and the dead entombed in the Stark family crypt, who attack those sheltered there. Wights pull Daenerys from Drogon and Jorah is fatally wounded defending her. The Night King kills Theon as he protects Bran. Arya ambushes and stabs the Night King with her Valyrian steel dagger shattering him and his White Walkers and Viserion and all wights. Her purpose served; Melisandre allows herself to die of old age.\",\"The survivors mourn, burn the dead and then celebrate their victory. During the somber feast, Daenerys uplifts the mood by legitimizing Gendry as a Baratheon, naming him Lord of Storm's End. Arya gently declines Gendry's subsequent marriage proposal while Jaime and Brienne become lovers. To protect her claim to the throne, Daenerys asks Jon to conceal his true parentage. Bronn arrives and threatens Jaime and Tyrion but spares them in exchange for being promised Highgarden castle. Jon reveals his true parentage to Sansa, Bran, and Arya, swearing them to secrecy. Wanting Jon as king, Sansa tells Tyrion, who informs Varys. Arya and the Hound head for King's Landing, separately bent on revenge. Tormund returns north with the Wildlings, taking Ghost at Jon's request. Daenerys and her fleet set sail for King's Landing, while Jon leads the Northern army. At Dragonstone, Euron's navy ambushes Daenerys' fleet, killing Rhaegal with ship-mounted ballistas. Missandei is taken hostage and Daenerys considers seizing King's Landing using dragonfire. Varys and Tyrion debate whether Jon would be a better ruler than Daenerys. Jaime leaves Winterfell to return to Cersei, despite Brienne's pleas to stay. Cersei rejects Daenerys' demand to surrender and has Missandei beheaded before an enraged Daenerys and Grey Worm.\",\"Varys urges Jon to advance his claim to the throne but Jon refuses to betray Daenerys. After Tyrion reveals Varys' plot, Daenerys executes Varys by dragon-fire. Jaime is captured but Tyrion releases him so Jaime can persuade Cersei to surrender the city and then escape Westeros together. Jaime, Arya and the Hound each infiltrate King's Landing. Riding Drogon, Daenerys destroys the Iron Fleet and most of the city's defenses, allowing her army to enter. Cersei's forces are quickly overwhelmed and the city signals its surrender. An enraged Daenerys begins leveling the city, burning soldiers and civilians. The allied army follows her lead, slaughtering anyone in their path, horrifying Tyrion and Jon. Jaime kills Euron but is mortally wounded. The Hound convinces Arya to abandon her vendetta against Cersei and save herself; then he confronts the Mountain. The brothers, battling each other, ultimately perish after falling from a tower into flames. Cersei and Jaime reunite but are killed as the Red Keep collapses on them. Jon calls for a retreat as frantic civilians flee the devastation. Arya barely escapes alive.\",\"Jon is appalled when the Unsullied execute captured soldiers upon Daenerys' orders. Tyrion finds Jaime and Cersei dead in the ruins. Daenerys rallies the Unsullied and Dothraki, proclaiming she will lead them to \\\"liberate\\\" the entire world. Tyrion resigns as Hand of the Queen and is imprisoned for treason. Arya and Tyrion separately warn Jon that Daenerys is a threat to him, House Stark and the people. Jon confronts Daenerys. Unable to halt her destructive path, an agonized Jon kills her. Drogon, enraged, melts the Iron Throne, then carries away Daenerys' body. Later, Tyrion proposes that all future monarchs be chosen by Westerosi leaders, rather than familial succession. Bran Stark is proclaimed King Bran the Broken. He grants the North independence as a kingdom and appoints Tyrion his Hand. Jon is sentenced to the Night's Watch to appease the Unsullied, who set sail for Naath, Missandei's homeland. Tyrion reorganizes the Small Council \\u2013 Brienne, Bronn, Davos and Sam \\u2013 to rebuild King's Landing. Podrick is knighted. Sansa is crowned Queen in the North. Arya sets sail to explore unknown lands west of Westeros. Jon rejoins Tormund and Ghost at Castle Black, leading the Wildlings north of the Wall.\"],\"shape\":[73],\"dtype\":\"object\",\"order\":\"little\"}],[\"total_score\",{\"type\":\"ndarray\",\"array\":{\"type\":\"bytes\",\"data\":\"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\"},\"shape\":[73],\"dtype\":\"float64\",\"order\":\"little\"}]]}}},\"view\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"CDSView\",\"id\":\"p1058\",\"attributes\":{\"filter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"AllIndices\",\"id\":\"p1059\"}}},\"glyph\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"Circle\",\"id\":\"p1054\",\"attributes\":{\"x\":{\"type\":\"field\",\"field\":\"U.S. Viewers (Millions)\"},\"y\":{\"type\":\"field\",\"field\":\"total_score\"},\"size\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":20},\"line_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"},\"fill_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"},\"hatch_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"}}},\"nonselection_glyph\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"Circle\",\"id\":\"p1055\",\"attributes\":{\"x\":{\"type\":\"field\",\"field\":\"U.S. Viewers (Millions)\"},\"y\":{\"type\":\"field\",\"field\":\"total_score\"},\"size\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":20},\"line_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":0.1},\"fill_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"},\"fill_alpha\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":0.1},\"hatch_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":0.1}}},\"muted_glyph\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"Circle\",\"id\":\"p1056\",\"attributes\":{\"x\":{\"type\":\"field\",\"field\":\"U.S. Viewers (Millions)\"},\"y\":{\"type\":\"field\",\"field\":\"total_score\"},\"size\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":20},\"line_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"},\"line_alpha\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":0.2},\"fill_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"},\"fill_alpha\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":0.2},\"hatch_color\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":\"green\"},\"hatch_alpha\":{\"type\":\"value\",\"value\":0.2}}}}}],\"toolbar\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"Toolbar\",\"id\":\"p1011\",\"attributes\":{\"tools\":[{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"PanTool\",\"id\":\"p1036\"},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"WheelZoomTool\",\"id\":\"p1037\"},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"BoxZoomTool\",\"id\":\"p1038\",\"attributes\":{\"overlay\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"BoxAnnotation\",\"id\":\"p1039\",\"attributes\":{\"syncable\":false,\"level\":\"overlay\",\"visible\":false,\"left_units\":\"canvas\",\"right_units\":\"canvas\",\"bottom_units\":\"canvas\",\"top_units\":\"canvas\",\"line_color\":\"black\",\"line_alpha\":1.0,\"line_width\":2,\"line_dash\":[4,4],\"fill_color\":\"lightgrey\",\"fill_alpha\":0.5}}}},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"SaveTool\",\"id\":\"p1040\"},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"ResetTool\",\"id\":\"p1041\"},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"HelpTool\",\"id\":\"p1042\"},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"HoverTool\",\"id\":\"p1061\",\"attributes\":{\"renderers\":\"auto\",\"tooltips\":[[\"Directed by\",\"@Director\"],[\"Written by\",\"@Writter\"],[\"Season\",\"@Season\"],[\"Episode\",\"@Episode\"]]}}]}},\"left\":[{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"LinearAxis\",\"id\":\"p1029\",\"attributes\":{\"ticker\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"BasicTicker\",\"id\":\"p1031\",\"attributes\":{\"mantissas\":[1,2,5]}},\"formatter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"BasicTickFormatter\",\"id\":\"p1030\"},\"axis_label\":\"total score\",\"major_label_policy\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"AllLabels\",\"id\":\"p1032\"}}}],\"below\":[{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"LinearAxis\",\"id\":\"p1022\",\"attributes\":{\"ticker\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"BasicTicker\",\"id\":\"p1024\",\"attributes\":{\"mantissas\":[1,2,5]}},\"formatter\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"BasicTickFormatter\",\"id\":\"p1023\"},\"axis_label\":\"Viewers\",\"major_label_policy\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"AllLabels\",\"id\":\"p1025\"}}}],\"center\":[{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"Grid\",\"id\":\"p1028\",\"attributes\":{\"axis\":{\"id\":\"p1022\"}}},{\"type\":\"object\",\"name\":\"Grid\",\"id\":\"p1035\",\"attributes\":{\"dimension\":1,\"axis\":{\"id\":\"p1029\"}}}]}}]}};\n",
